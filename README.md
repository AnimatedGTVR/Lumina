# Lumina VR Lighting System

Lumina VR is an advanced lighting system designed specifically for Unity, leveraging cutting-edge ray-tracing and path-tracing technologies to deliver unparalleled lighting fidelity and realism in virtual reality environments. Transform your VR projects with dynamic, efficient, and customizable lighting solutions.

## Features

### 1. Leverage Ray-Tracing Technology
- Use ray-tracing or path-tracing for global illumination (GI) during baking.
- Integrate ray-traced reflections and ambient occlusion.
- Utilize APIs like OptiX or Vulkan RT for GPU acceleration.

### 2. Advanced Material Handling
- Implement PBR (Physically Based Rendering) with precise control over albedo, metallic, roughness, and normal textures.
- Support clear coat, subsurface scattering, and translucency for highly realistic materials.
- Use adaptive texture baking, where UV resolution adjusts dynamically to maintain consistency.

### 3. Modular Baked Lighting Layers
- Allow separate layers for:
  - Diffuse lighting
  - Specular highlights
  - Ambient occlusion
  - Indirect lighting
- Combine these layers dynamically in the runtime shader for added control.

### 4. Volumetric Lighting and Shadow Baking
- Introduce volumetric lightmaps that account for fog, light scattering, and atmospheric effects.
- Bake contact shadows and area light falloff for ultra-realistic shading.

### 5. Realistic Light Probes
- Enhance Unity's light probe system to account for:
  - High dynamic range (HDR) lighting.
  - Accurate occlusion.
  - Dynamic light bouncing.

### 6. Dynamic Baking Updates
- Implement incremental baking for faster updates.
- Use AI-driven prediction for dynamic light changes based on scene configuration.
- Enable baking for runtime changes, allowing seamless transitions between static and dynamic lighting.

### 7. Hybrid Lighting System
- Use baked lighting for static objects.
- Incorporate real-time lighting for dynamic objects and blend them seamlessly.

### 8. Hardware Optimization
- Optimize baking for GPUs using CUDA, OpenCL, or Metal.
- Provide multi-threaded baking capabilities on CPUs.

### 9. High-Quality Output Formats
- Export to advanced formats like EXR, HDR, or DDS for lossless lighting fidelity.
- Offer downscaling options for mobile and performance-constrained platforms.

### 10. Workflow Integration
- Seamlessly integrate into Unity's Editor with a user-friendly UI.
- Support batch baking for large-scale scenes.
- Provide debug tools to analyze lightmaps, detect artifacts, and optimize resource usage.

## Implementation Tools

### Custom Plugins
- Develop a Unity plugin using low-level graphics APIs (DirectX, Vulkan, OpenGL).

### External Tools
- Integrate with industry-standard rendering tools like Blender (Cycles), Unreal's Lightmass, or Renderman.

### Machine Learning
- Use ML to interpolate GI and optimize baking time for ultra-large environments.

## Rendering Pipeline Support
- Fully compatible with Unity's HDRP and URP, leveraging their advanced rendering features.
